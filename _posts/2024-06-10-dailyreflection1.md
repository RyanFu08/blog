Ok, so I just finished writing the sophomore reflection post, and my mom wants me to be more productive this summer by writing daily reflections as well. It is a lot of reflecting I am doing right now, but it is probably good. I'll make this more detailed in the future (tomorrow, surely).

I don't want this to clutter my blog too much, so I'll probably post this biweekly or something. Not too interesting, but just a way to be accountable and stuff.

#### Monday, June 10, 2024

- Started off the day with solving a DS1 problem which I had left behind, [Groceries in Meteor Town](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1628/E). Pretty interesting problem, uses DS and graph nicely. 
- Also messed around with some webdev stuff on WebPlotDigitizer, to try to familiarize myself with it, but I didn't do anything significant - mainly just understand some of the underlying structure of `index.html` and `wpd.min.js`. Main takeaway is that I'm pretty shit at understanding HTML, JS, CSS, so I'm going to take a course.
- Made some blog posts which is cool
- Did not shower before 11:27 PM which is not optimal

I would rate this day like 3/10. I had already made some progress on the problem some time before, so a lot of time was killed debugging. Not very locked in.

Plan for tomorrow: 
- Solve >= 1 problem on DS1, or plat, or something similar
- Finish [relevant unit of measure, haven't looked too much into it] for coursera on webdev of HTML JS CSS
- Hold office hours for CPI
- Grind more coursera (I've realized that doing webdev shit is pretty inefficient/impractical before I finish the course)
