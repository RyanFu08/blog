This is the first post of my blog. Currently, my idea is just to post random ideas I have here - although this may be subject to change. Additionally, it is more or less of an exercise to learn some webdev. Of course, this is just a plan, and definitely subject to change.

This post will be one of the few "meta" posts (about the blog itself). After all, there are things far more interesting than this blog to write about. However, I've seen other people do this, and it seems to be constructive to talk about some of this stuff.

I really only got the motivation to "start" this blog because I was on a plane for a long time (family vacation stuff) and I was bored/burnt out. It's deployed on my github pages of course, and it uses the [Mediumish](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll) theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Coincedentally, this is also the theme that Maxwell Zhang (XCamp 602 teacher, orz) uses, and I read his blogs sometimes.

The inspiration for this blog came from a lot of different places. I've noticed that a lot of people have their own blogs, and I thought it'd be pretty cool to have one myself. Perhaps the most closely analogous one is [Rohan Garg's Blog](https://radicai1.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2023-04-28T21:03:00-07:00&max-results=7&start=21&by-date=false), but I hope to post a bit more, and hope to rant about a few non-personal things as well. My mom also motivated me to start writing a blog in a sense - I was ranting about some philosophical topic, and she was like "you have a lot of interesting ideas, maybe you should keep a blog." I think she just wanted me to shut up, but it wasn't a bad idea. She also later said that it would help develop "identity", which would be useful in college apps, but I'm not sure how factual this may turn out to be. Finally, I feel like I DM people on discord a lot of random stuff I encounter, and it might be more constructive to have a place to record all of it. 

Hopefully someone is going to read all of this, at one point. If you happen to be that (unlucky) person, it'd be pretty gratifying to comment or something. I sound like a youtuber now, I guess, but whatever.

I wanted to make this more structured/formal/cohesive, but I'm pretty tired, maybe I'll come back and edit this later.
